# Build Graph for NPM dependencies with Graphviz

Give package name, get its dependencies in a fancy way

### How to use

1. Install necessary dependencies for program to work – `npm install`
2. Run it – `node index.js` or `node buildgraph.js` or `node run graph`
3. Type package name (in prompt) and then give permission (in prompt) for file to write
4. Check generated Graphviz file and built picture in `result` folder

ALso you can start program with parameter from command line just like that:
`node buildgraph.js express` or `node index axios` 

### Submodule
Can be included to existing parent git as submodule with `git submodule add ./hometask2 ./hometask2`
